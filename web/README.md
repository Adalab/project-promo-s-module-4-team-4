# Cool Project Station

For the third module in this bootcamp we had to finish the functions of a website and improve its appearance using mainly React.

## Functionality

For this project, a project library was required. It was designed as a two part one, with a main part constituted by the landing page of the library and a secondary one with the library itself.
The main part of the website includes the possibility of the creation of a virtual card through a formulary, with information about projects introduced by the user such as the repository, the web or the languages used.
The other part includes the presentation about the project cards introduced in the landing page.
